We held weekly virtual meetings to assign tasks, review each otherâ€™s code, and merge branches in a shared Git repository. 

One of our hardest bugs occurred when merging two SingleNode objects into a new internal node. We discovered after several 
test runs that our insertSorted logic was not maintaining strict ascending order when two nodes had equal frequency. 
As a result, the order of merging changed and produced a different Huffman tree (still valid but inconsistent codes). 
We fixed this by adjusting the comparison in insertSorted so that if frequencies are equal, we compare characters 
(or simply decide to insert new nodes after existing ones). After that change, tests for sample inputs consistently 
produced the same codes.
