Plain-Text File Compression
When you save a .txt file in many zip or compression utilities, the program often applies a basic Huffman‐coding step.
For example, if a text document has many repeated letters (like “e” or “t”), Huffman replaces them with shorter bit patterns. 
This reduces the overall file size so you can send or store the text more efficiently.

Prefix-Code Encoding in a Text-Based Game or Chat App
If you write a simple chat program or a text-only game that runs over a slow network (say a BASIC terminal connection), 
you could assign common letters (like space, “e”, “t”) very short bit codes. Every message the user sends is first Huffman-encoded before 
transmission and then decoded on the other side. This means fewer bits on the wire and faster updates in a low-bandwidth environment.

Reducing Size of Email Attachments (Basic Archive Formats)
Even before full “.zip” or “.rar” formats, some simple archive tools apply Huffman coding to group of files. For example, an email client 
that bundles several .csv or .log files might run a quick Huffman step over each file’s contents so the total attachment is smaller.
